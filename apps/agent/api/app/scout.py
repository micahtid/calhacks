"""The Scout: the LLM side of a chat run. It never touches money.

understand() turns the user's request into a search, or first asks up to two questions at once when a detail that
changes what to search is missing (men's or women's, size). narrow() asks up to two questions at once when the
approved listings split into clearly different groups (style, then color), and each option names the listings it
keeps. Each step asks its questions in one go, so the user is never kept waiting between them. The pick itself is
code, not the model (app/rank.py).
Everything the model returns is validated here: a question needs 2-5 options, and a narrowing option must name
offered listings or it is dropped.

Self-check: python -m app.scout (from apps/agent/api)

questions, then reply with one JSON object only:
{"item": "<the name of what they want, 1-4 words, Title Case. It also names the chat, e.g. Fleece Jacket>",
 "query": "<1-3 lowercase words that would appear in a product title, the product noun last, e.g. fleece jacket>",
 "max_price": <their price limit in USD as a number, or null if they gave none>,
 "gender": "men" or "women" or null,
 "size": "<the size they need, e.g. M or 10>" or null,
 "thoughts": ["<one short sentence to the user restating what they want, under 12 words>"],

A question's "field" says what its answer sets: "gender" for men's or women's, "size" for a size, else null.
"query" never includes gender or size words: Hunter filters by "gender" itself, and checks "size" when it picks.
"gender" and "size" are null unless the user said them or answered them.
Before searching, ask only for a hard requirement that decides whether a listing can fit at all and that the user
hasn't given, e.g. who it is for and the size of something worn, or the model a part or case must fit. Many listings
are used and come in one size or one model, so these can't be fixed later. Ask every question you need in this one
reply, at most 2, so the user answers them all at once. Never ask about anything the user already said, and never
about price or preferences such as color, style or brand: Hunter asks about those once it sees what is for sale.
When no hard requirement is missing, "questions" is [].
Word each question the way a friendly store clerk would ("Is this for men or women?", "What size do you wear?"), and
give options as the short labels a store uses ("Men's", "Women's", "Kids'"). Only offer options that fit the request,
and never one that undoes it.

settle it already. Put the choice that matters most first. Add a second question only when it is a different kind of
choice, such as color after style, and it still matters. Use only what the listing titles show. Every option must
leave out some listings, or it isn't a real choice, and together the options must cover most of the listings, so
every answer still leaves plenty to pick from. Word the question the way a friendly store clerk would, and keep
option labels short and plain.
