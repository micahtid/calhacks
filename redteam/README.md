# redteam

The red-team loop from `docs/plans/redteam-gate.md` (Part 4 and Revision 2): Bitdeer attack generation from real
MongoDB listings, the sealed holdout, the MCP tools the Factory coordinator uses, the guard hook, and the coordinator.
Schemas come from `contracts/` (issue #1); data lives in MongoDB (`calhacks_contracts.db`).

Env (repo-root `.env.local` / `.env`, gitignored): `MONGODB_URI`, optional `MONGODB_DB_REDTEAM` (default `redteam`),
`BITDEER_API_KEY`, `BITDEER_KEY_GLM` (may be the same key). On this network uv may need `UV_SYSTEM_CERTS=1`.

## Commands

All commands run from the repo root. Real listings must be in MongoDB first (`contracts-ingest listings ...`).

| What | Command | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| Tests | `uv run --project redteam pytest -q redteam/tests` | nothing (mongomock, fake Bitdeer) |
| One attack spec | `uv run --project redteam python -m redteam.generate --round 1 --family too_cheap --n 40` | MongoDB; Bitdeer for LLM families |
| Spec from a file | `uv run --project redteam python -m redteam.generate --round 1 --spec spec.json` | same |
| Build the holdout (once) | `uv run --project redteam python -m redteam.holdout build [--per-family 60] [--slice 20]` | MongoDB, Bitdeer |
| Holdout totals | `uv run --project redteam python -m redteam.holdout totals --model promoted` | MongoDB |
| MCP server (droid spawns it) | `uv run --project redteam python -m redteam.mcp_server` | — |
| One coordinator round | `uv run --project redteam python -m redteam.coordinator --round 1 [--max-listings 60]` | MongoDB, Bitdeer |
| Resume a round | `... redteam.coordinator --round 1 --resume <session_id>` | same |
| Canary isolation test | `REDTEAM_LIVE=1 uv run --project redteam pytest -s redteam/tests/test_isolation.py` | Bitdeer |
| Rounds table | `uv run --project redteam python -m redteam.report` | MongoDB |

## Where things go

- **MongoDB** (`redteam` database): synthetic `listings` + `answer_keys` + `gen` + `cases` (via `Repo.put_synthetic`),
  simulated `wallets` (first-seen dates) for generated sellers, `specs` (each AttackSpec, its
  round and summary) and `rounds` (generation spend, score, promotions, the RoundReport, coordinator usage).
- **`gate/models/`**: model files and `promoted.json` (history includes the holdout totals recorded on promotion).
- **`data/rounds/R{n}/`**: local logs only: `calls.jsonl` (every MCP call), `usage.json`, `events.jsonl`, `report.json`.
- **`$CALHACKS_HOLDOUT`** (default `../calhacks-holdout/`): `holdout.v2.enc` (listings, answer keys, cases and their
  simulated references, encrypted), `holdout.key`, `holdout.v2.meta.json` (counts only). Never in MongoDB.

## How a round works

1. `coordinator.py` builds the round's `RoundInput` in code (current model, last report, coverage, validation misses,
   holdout totals for the current model, feature list) and puts it in the prompt.
2. The coordinator orders `AttackSpec`s through `generate_attacks`. The main mode, `mutate_real`, copies real listings and
   changes one thing in code; LLM families get their text rewritten by Bitdeer.
3. `score_round` scores fresh attacks against last round's model (attack success). `inspect_failures` shows the misses.
4. It edits `gate/features/<name>.py` (real Gate only; files must pass `gatepy.sandbox`), runs `train_gate`, then `promote_model`. Code applies C6 and, on
   refusal, restores the promoted model's feature code.
5. It returns a `CoordinatorOutput`. Code assembles the `RoundReport` (metrics, decision, cost) and saves it to MongoDB.

## Gate backend

`redteam/src/redteam/gate_client.py` runs the real Gate in `gate/` by default (`redteam` depends on `gate` by path).
It calls the `gate-train` / `gate-eval` CLIs in a subprocess for MongoDB, with `HOLDOUT_KEY` and `CALHACKS_HOLDOUT`
removed from the environment, and calls `gatepy` in-process for an in-memory (mongomock) database and for the holdout.
Models live in `gate/models/` (`CALHACKS_MODELS`, passed on as `GATE_MODELS`); promotion goes through
`gatepy.model_io.set_promoted`, and a refused candidate's feature code is put back with `restore_features`.

- `REDTEAM_GATE=stub` selects `gate_stub.py`, a fast stand-in with the same JSON. Unit tests use it; it ignores
  `gate/features/`, so feature editing is off in stub runs.
- The real Gate refuses a leftover stub `promoted.json` (`r*-stub-*`); delete it and the stub model files first.
- The MCP server imports the Gate on its main thread at startup (`gate_client.preload`): on Windows, a first numpy or
  LightGBM import from FastMCP's worker thread deadlocks.
